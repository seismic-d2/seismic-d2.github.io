<h5 style="color: #ff9019">ABOUT THIS EVENT</h5>
This is a sherpa event: our group of mentors and experienced players plays the raid together with you. We explain mechanics, strategies and loadouts thoroughly as we go from one encounter to another, and help you learn and execute them. As with any learning experience, some amount of discipline, patience and additional time is needed. It should take around three to four hours to complete the raid, with all explanations included.

<h5 style="color: #ff9019">IMPORTANT NOTES</h5>
We select participants based on who needs the sherpa the most, so in most cases people with least amount of clears of this raid are chosen, with some exceptions. Order of sign ups doesn't matter.

<h5 style="color: #ff9019">SHERPA RAID RULES</h5>
- Don't place rally banners. Please leave that to mentors.
- We kindly ask you to not interrupt explanations with either questions or additions. For questions, we try our best to make enough breaks for you to ask them, and for additions please leave it to mentors to make their own way of explaining things in this event since they host it. We are open to any critique in the form of feedback through DMs or channels though!
- Please sign up not later than 2 hours before the event. That's when we check the list of participants and issue a ping to let people know that they should arrive for the run.
