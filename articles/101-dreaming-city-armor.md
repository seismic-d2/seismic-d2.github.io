btw
for @SG_Am_I_Zak @SG_Zearo and people who want to do Petra's  
Riven DPS might be a slippery task in different seasons. I suggest that you collect some Reverie Dawn armor from dreaming city, it has Riven's Curse mod preinstalled.  
The mod gives you additional 5% of all outcoming damage, stacks multiplicatively with EVERYTHING else and stacks between copies of this mod, giving you 25% of additional damage literally for free with full set of that armor  
you can store it and switch to it just for Riven cheese in the run
