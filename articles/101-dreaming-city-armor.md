# Riven DPS and Reverie Dawn armour

Riven DPS check is an important part of Petra's run, you have to be able to pass it reliably.  

Full set of **Reverie Dawn** armour adds 25% to your damage output on top all other buffs/debuffs you can apply. How does it work?

Every piece of RD amour that you get from Dreaming City activities (Shattered Throne dungeon, Blind Well and others) comes with this mod pre-installed in the first mod slot. You can replace it with a normal mod, but Riven's Curse will be lost completely. Each copy of this mod adds 5% to your damage output and also adds 2% to all damage incflicted to your character, which results in 25% dmg output increase and 10% dmg received increase. But in Riven encounter you are not hard pressed with surviving incoming fire, so those 10% are not noticeable.

You might want to get a full set and equip it after Vault encounter just for this one Riven cheese stage to increase your chances on passing the DPS check consistently, and then return to your normal armor again for Queenswalk.

### Bonus tips

There is also another version of Riven's Curse called **Transcendent Blessing**. It's the same thing, but it doesn't have that 2% increase of incoming damage. To get it, you should take a certain weekly quest from Petra Venj and complete it. You will be rewarded with 1 item of this mod, which you can install in any piece of armor only once. Just like Riven's Curse, Transcendent Blessing will be lost in case of being replaced with another mod.
