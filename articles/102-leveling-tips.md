Okay, let's make it really short for basic concepts. If you want more in-depth breakdown, there is also the second part down below.

So, there are three stages of leveling up in Destiny 2. You only need the first two, the third one is very optional.

### Basic leveling

First 150 levels (1600-1750). Every loot drop will try to increase your power level.

### Powerful grind

Second 50 levels (1750-1800). Common loot drops *will not* increase your PL anymore. To increase your power level, you must look at your Director screen and search for small shining golden icons attached to different nodes. They are called **Challenges** and they can give you either Powerful Gear or Pinnacle Gear, this is what will increase your power level at this stage. 

### Pinnacle grind

Last 10 levels (1800-1810). Common loot drops and Powerful rewards *will not* increase your Power Level. Just like with powerful grind, you need to complete challenges from Director, but now only Pinnacle Gear will try to increase your level.

This is what Challenges look like in Director:

That's all for the "basics" part.

## 2. Power leveling intricacies

Okay, so you want MORE. Let's talk about the math behind those level-ups.

Power level of the loot you receive is calculated based on your power level, but it is not the number you see on your character screen. You can actually find that number in the game if you go to your season pass and hover over any weapon or armor piece in there, because items from season pass always drop at that base value.

That base number is calculated as if you took your highest-level item in each slot and equipped it. That is your highest theoretically possible average gear level. Theoretically, because sometimes it's two exotics in different slots that *hold* those max PLs in those slots. So you can't really equip them together, but that base PL value doesn't care about it in its calculations.

Wherever those items reside does not matter: equipped, inventory, vault, postmaster - the game will include them in that calculation. Armor pieces for another classes will not be included, but weapons will, meaning that by leveling one of your characters you "pull" power level of your other characters up a bit. And no, you can't create three characters of the same class to get 3x challenges. Every challenge only works once per week *per class*, not per character.

You can actually use DIM (Destiny Item Manager) to get a quick and simple overview of your current base gear level and items that *hold* it. You just need to click on the number next to the helmet icon just below your character emblem:

You can also see how far ahead/behind your slots are.

As you can guess, if you have some of your slots far behind your average level, you don't really have to chase level-ups, because you can receive an on-level reward in that slot, increasing average value. On the other hand, if you have some slots far ahead of your average, receiving level-ups in thos slots will not increage the average number, which means that the reward was essentially wasted. That's why you want to keep your slots on the same power level if you want to *really* optimize your leveling.
